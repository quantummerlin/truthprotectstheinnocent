## Current Status

Based on information from supporters close to the family, the situation will continue for "some time longer." This makes sustained public support more critical than ever.

## Legal Strategy Shift

The family's legal team has unanimously agreed to change strategies. The previous approach of silence gave the facility, social workers, and court freedom to continue actions that supporters describe as harmful to the family and children.

The new strategy involves:
- Continued legal fight by the family's lawyer
- Utilization of public support and pressure
- Family focusing on staying healthy for their children

## The Three False Justifications

According to supporters with knowledge of the case, all three primary justifications given for removing the children have been systematically proven false by official sources:

### 1. Vaccination Status
**Claim:** Children were not vaccinated
**Truth:** The Assembly of Chieti and Teramo confirmed the children WERE vaccinated

### 2. Education Status
**Claim:** Children were not being properly educated
**Truth:** The Ministry of Education confirmed the children correctly followed legal parental instruction (homeschooling), like 15,000+ other children in Italy

### 3. Housing Safety
**Claim:** The house was unsafe
**Truth:** A certified geometer confirmed the structure is NOT at risk of stability

## Psychological Assessment Findings

A qualified psychologist has assessed the children since their removal. The findings were significant enough that the psychologist held a formal press conference:

**Key finding:** The children are now exhibiting self-harm behaviors — behaviors that did not exist before the separation.

This is documented evidence that the intervention itself is causing harm to the children it was supposed to protect.

## The Call to Speak Out

The message from supporters is clear: **"It's time for people to make their voices and truths heard."**

While the family faces restrictions and surveillance, the public has the freedom and right to:
- Speak the truth
- Write letters to officials
- Sign petitions
- Share factual information
- Contact media
- Support a family that has done nothing wrong

## International Attention

- The Australian Embassy has been contacted and is aware of the case
- Both the Prime Minister of Australia and Italian government officials are now aware
- This has become a matter of international diplomatic concern

## What You Can Do

1. **[Email Italian officials](/action/#email)** — Use the template provided

3. **Share the story** — Use #TruthProtectsTheInnocent
4. **Contact media** — Help get this story covered

## The Central Question

If all three official justifications have been proven false, what is the legal basis for continued separation?

This question deserves an answer. Public pressure helps ensure it gets one.
