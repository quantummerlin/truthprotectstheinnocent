## The Official Story Falls Apart

Italian authorities gave three reasons for removing the Birmingham-Trevallion children from their parents. Documentation has now emerged showing that all three claims are contradicted by official Italian sources.

## Claim #1: "Children Not Vaccinated"

**What authorities claimed:** The children were not vaccinated.

**What official records show:** The Assembly of Chieti and Teramo — the regional health authority — confirmed the children **were vaccinated**. Records indicate they received more vaccinations than the minimum required, described as "exaggerated."

**Status: DISPROVEN**

## Claim #2: "Children Not Educated"

**What authorities claimed:** The children were not receiving proper education.

**What official records show:** The Ministry of Education confirmed the children **correctly followed parental instruction** (istruzione parentale) — the legal education framework in Italy.

**Context:** Over 15,000 children in Italy are educated through parental instruction. It is legal under Article 30 of the Italian Constitution.

**Status: DISPROVEN**

## Claim #3: "House Unsafe"

**What authorities claimed:** The family's home was unsafe or structurally unsound.

**What official records show:** A certified **geometer** (professional structural assessor) confirmed the structure is **not at risk of stability**.

**Status: DISPROVEN**

## The Unanswered Question

Under Italian law, child removal requires evidence of "exceptional gravity."

If all three stated justifications have been contradicted by official sources:
- What constitutes the "exceptional gravity"?
- What is the legal basis for continued separation?
- Why are these children still not with their parents?

These questions deserve answers.

## Why This Matters

This is not a case of authorities making difficult judgment calls in a complex situation. This is a case where:

1. Specific claims were made to justify child removal
2. Each claim has been contradicted by official Italian sources
3. The children remain separated anyway
4. The children are now showing documented psychological harm

## What You Can Do

When contacting officials or media, reference these specific facts:

- "The Assembly of Chieti and Teramo confirmed the children were vaccinated"
- "The Ministry of Education confirmed legal parental instruction"
- "A certified geometer confirmed structural safety"

Ask the direct question: **If all justifications are false, what is the legal basis for this separation?**
