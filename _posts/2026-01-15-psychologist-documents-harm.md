## Press Conference Held

A qualified psychologist who assessed the Birmingham-Trevallion children has held a formal press conference to present findings about the psychological impact of the separation.

## Key Finding

**The children are now exhibiting self-harm behaviors.**

These behaviors did not exist before the children were removed from their parents.

## What This Means

The intervention that was intended to "protect" these children is causing documented psychological harm.

Before the removal:
- Children were described as healthy and happy
- No psychological issues documented
- Stable family environment

After the removal:
- Self-harm behaviors emerging
- Psychological trauma documented
- Separation from primary caregivers

## The Significance

This finding is significant for several reasons:

1. **It contradicts the premise of the intervention** — Child removal is supposed to protect children, not harm them

2. **It provides documented evidence** — This is not speculation; it's a professional psychological assessment

3. **It was made public** — The psychologist felt strongly enough about the findings to hold a press conference

4. **It raises urgent questions** — How can continued separation be justified when it's causing documented harm?

## The Question Officials Must Answer

If the intervention is causing the children psychological harm — harm that did not exist before — how can it be considered "protection"?

At what point does "child protection" become child harm?

## What You Can Do

When writing to officials or sharing this story, reference this documented harm:

- A psychological assessment found self-harm behaviors in the children
- These behaviors did not exist before the separation
- The intervention is causing documented harm
- This raises serious questions about the justification for continued separation
