## The Three Official Justifications

Italian authorities gave three reasons for removing the children from their parents. **Each one has been disproven by official Italian sources.**

---

### Claim #1: "Children Not Vaccinated"

<div class="evidence-card">
<div class="evidence-header">
<h4>What Authorities Claimed</h4>
<span class="evidence-badge badge-disputed">DISPROVEN</span>
</div>

**The claim:** The children were not vaccinated.

**The evidence:** The Assembly of Chieti and Teramo confirmed the children **were vaccinated**. Records indicate the vaccinations were described as "exaggerated" — meaning more than the minimum required.

**Source:** Regional health authority records (Assembly of Chieti and Teramo)
</div>

### Claim #2: "Children Not Educated"

<div class="evidence-card">
<div class="evidence-header">
<h4>What Authorities Claimed</h4>
<span class="evidence-badge badge-disputed">DISPROVEN</span>
</div>

**The claim:** The children were not receiving proper education.

**The evidence:** The Ministry of Education confirmed the children **correctly followed parental instruction** (istruzione parentale) — the legal homeschooling framework used by over 15,000 children across Italy.

**Source:** Ministry of Education confirmation

**Legal context:** Homeschooling is protected under Article 30 of the Italian Constitution and regulated by ministerial guidelines. It is not illegal. It is not unusual. Over 15,000 Italian children are educated this way.

### Claim #3: "House Unsafe"

<div class="evidence-card">
<div class="evidence-header">
<h4>What Authorities Claimed</h4>
<span class="evidence-badge badge-disputed">DISPROVEN</span>
</div>

**The claim:** The family's home was unsafe or structurally unsound.

**The evidence:** A certified **geometer** (professional surveyor/structural assessor) confirmed the structure is **not at risk of stability**.

**Source:** Professional structural assessment by certified geometer

**Context:** The home may be unconventional — the family chose to live simply and close to nature — but unconventional is not unsafe. The professional assessment confirms the structure is sound.

## The Central Question

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">If all three justifications are false, what is the legal basis for this separation?</h3>

Under Italian law, child removal requires evidence of "exceptional gravity." 

The three reasons given were:
1. Vaccination status — **proven false**
2. Education status — **proven false**
3. Housing safety — **proven false**

**What remains?**

No abuse has been alleged. No neglect has been proven. No crime has been committed.

Three children remain separated from their parents based on justifications that have been officially disproven.

## Documented Harm from the Intervention

### Psychological Assessment Findings

A qualified psychologist conducted an assessment of the children following their removal. The findings were significant enough that the psychologist held a formal press conference to present them.

<div class="evidence-header">
<h4>Assessment Finding</h4>
<span class="evidence-badge badge-verified">DOCUMENTED</span>
</div>

**Finding:** The children are now exhibiting **self-harm behaviors**.

**Critical detail:** These behaviors **did not exist before the separation**.

**Implication:** The intervention that was intended to "protect" these children is causing measurable psychological harm.
</div>

### Before vs. After

| Before Removal | After Removal |
|----------------|---------------|
| Children described as healthy and happy | Children showing self-harm behaviors |
| Outdoor lifestyle, close to nature | Institutional care environment |
| Limited screen time | Exposure to screens and TV |
| Regular routines with parents | Separation from primary caregivers |
| No documented psychological issues | Documented psychological trauma |

**The evidence is clear:** The harm is being caused by the intervention, not by the family's lifestyle.

## How to Use This Evidence

### When Writing to Officials
Reference the specific evidence:
- "The Assembly of Chieti and Teramo confirmed the children were vaccinated"
- "The Ministry of Education confirmed legal homeschooling"
- "A certified geometer confirmed structural safety"
- "A psychological assessment documented self-harm behaviors emerging after separation"

Ask the direct question: **If all justifications are false, what is the legal basis for continued separation?**

### When Contacting Media
Lead with the contradiction:
- Three official reasons given for child removal
- All three proven false by official sources
- Children still separated
- Now showing documented psychological harm

This is the story: **Official justifications don't hold up. What's really going on?**

### When Sharing on Social Media
Focus on the facts:
- Three claims, all disproven
- Children now harmed by the "protection"
- No abuse, no neglect, no crime — just a family that lived differently
