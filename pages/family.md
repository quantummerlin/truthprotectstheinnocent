## An Australian Family in Italy

The Birmingham-Trevallion family — Nathan, Catherine, and their three children — are Australian citizens who chose to make their home in rural Italy. They made deliberate choices about how to raise their family:

- **Homeschooling** — Following Italy's legal "istruzione parentale" (parental instruction) framework, the same model used by over 15,000 families across Italy
- **Rural living** — Choosing to live in the countryside, close to nature
- **Limited screen time** — Prioritizing outdoor activities and hands-on learning over television and devices
- **Simple lifestyle** — Living modestly and sustainably

These choices are legal. They are not unusual. Thousands of families across Italy and Europe make similar choices every day.

## What Happened

In late 2025, Italian authorities removed the three children from their parents. The children were placed in institutional care. The family has been separated ever since.

The mother is permitted supervised visits but cannot stay with her children. The father's access has been restricted.

---

## The Official Reasons — And Why They Don't Hold Up

Authorities gave three reasons for the removal:

<div class="evidence-card verified">
<div class="evidence-header">
<h4>❌ "The children weren't vaccinated"</h4>
<span class="evidence-badge badge-disputed">FALSE</span>
</div>
<p>The Assembly of Chieti and Teramo — the regional health authority — confirmed the children <strong>were vaccinated</strong>. Records indicate they received more vaccinations than the minimum required.</p>
</div>

<div class="evidence-card verified">
<div class="evidence-header">
<h4>❌ "The children weren't being educated"</h4>
<span class="evidence-badge badge-disputed">FALSE</span>
</div>
<p>The Ministry of Education confirmed the children were correctly enrolled in <strong>parental instruction (homeschooling)</strong> — a legal educational option in Italy protected under Article 30 of the Constitution.</p>
</div>

<div class="evidence-card verified">
<div class="evidence-header">
<h4>❌ "The house was unsafe"</h4>
<span class="evidence-badge badge-disputed">FALSE</span>
</div>
<p>A certified <strong>geometer</strong> (professional structural assessor) confirmed the family's home is <strong>not at risk of structural instability</strong>.</p>
</div>

**All three official justifications have been contradicted by official Italian sources.**

## The Harm Being Caused

Since the separation, a qualified psychologist has assessed the children. The findings were serious enough that the psychologist held a formal press conference to present them publicly.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<strong>Key finding:</strong> The children are now exhibiting <strong>self-harm behaviors</strong> — behaviors that did not exist before they were removed from their parents.
</div>

Before the removal, those who knew the family described the children as healthy, happy, and thriving. They spent their days outdoors, learning from nature, connected to their parents.

Now, in institutional care, they are showing signs of psychological trauma directly caused by the separation itself.

**The intervention meant to "protect" these children is documented as causing them harm.**

---

## Why This Matters

This case raises serious questions:

- **If all official justifications have been proven false, what is the legal basis for continued separation?**
- **Why were these children removed when 15,000+ other homeschooling families in Italy are left alone?**
- **How can an intervention that is causing documented psychological harm be considered "protection"?**

These are not rhetorical questions. They deserve answers.

## The Family Cannot Speak — But We Can

Due to the ongoing legal situation, the family cannot speak publicly. They are focused on their legal case and on staying healthy for their children.

But the public has no such restriction.

We have the freedom to:
- Ask questions
- Share documented facts
- Write to officials
- Contact media
- Demand transparency

The family's supporters report that they have asked for public support — for people to speak the truth and not be silenced by fear.
