## Press Kit

### For Journalists

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Story Summary:</strong> Three children from an Australian family living in Italy were removed from their parents despite no evidence of abuse or neglect. All three official justifications for the removal have been proven false by official Italian sources. A psychologist has documented emerging self-harm behaviors in the children — behaviors that did not exist before the separation.
</div>

### Key Facts

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Family** | Birmingham-Trevallion (Australian citizens, living in Italy) |
| **Children** | 3 |
| **Separation began** | Late 2025 |
| **Official reasons given** | Vaccination status, education, housing safety |
| **Status of reasons** | All three contradicted by official Italian sources |
| **Current status** | Family remains separated |
| **Documented harm** | Self-harm behaviors emerging in children (per psychological assessment) |
| **International involvement** | Australian Embassy aware, both Prime Ministers informed |

## Story Angles

### Angle 1: "All Official Reasons Proven False"
Three justifications were given for removing children from their parents. All three have been contradicted by official Italian sources. Why are the children still separated?

### Angle 2: "Protection Causing Harm"
A psychologist documented that children who were healthy before removal are now showing self-harm behaviors. The intervention is causing the damage it was supposed to prevent.

### Angle 3: "International Diplomatic Situation"
An Australian family, Italian authorities, embassies involved, Prime Ministers informed. This local child welfare case has become an international incident.

### Angle 4: "One of 15,000 — Why This Family?"
Over 15,000 families legally homeschool in Italy. Only one had their children removed. What makes this family different?
