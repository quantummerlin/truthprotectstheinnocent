## Purpose

This website exists to document and share information about the Birmingham-Trevallion family case — a situation where three children were separated from their loving parents in Italy despite no evidence of abuse or neglect.

Our goals are:
- **Document the truth** — Collect and present verified information
- **Raise awareness** — Help people understand what happened
- **Enable action** — Provide tools for people to help
- **Support justice** — Contribute to family reunification

---

## Who We Are

This site is maintained by supporters of the family who believe in:

- **Family sovereignty** — Parents' rights to make decisions about their children's upbringing
- **Truth and transparency** — The public's right to know when injustice occurs
- **Due process** — Fair treatment under the law
- **Child welfare** — The genuine best interests of children

We are not lawyers, officials, or representatives of any organization. We are concerned individuals who believe this family deserves support.

## Our Principles

### 1. Truth Over Speculation
We share only information that has been verified or clearly attributed to sources. We do not speculate or spread rumors.

### 2. Respect for the Family

### 3. Protection of Children
We do not share identifying information about the children. Their safety and privacy are paramount.

### 4. Legal Caution
We are careful about what we publish. We attribute information to sources and avoid making claims we cannot support.

### 5. Constructive Action
We focus on actions that can help — writing letters, raising awareness, supporting the legal case — not on anger or blame.
