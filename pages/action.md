## Why Your Action Matters

The family is focused on their legal case and cannot speak publicly. **But we can.**

Every email, every share, every conversation creates pressure. When officials know the world is watching, they are more likely to act fairly.

**Silence enables injustice. Speaking up creates accountability.**

Copy and personalize this letter:

```
Egregio/a [Title and Name of Official],

mi chiamo [Your Name] e sono cittadino/a residente a [Your City/Country].

Le scrivo in merito a una situazione di preoccupazione umanitaria che riguarda 
la famiglia Birmingham-Trevallion, attualmente separata in Italia.

Secondo le informazioni disponibili, le tre principali giustificazioni fornite 
per la rimozione dei bambini sono state smentite da fonti ufficiali:

1. VACCINAZIONI: L'Assemblea di Chieti e Teramo ha confermato che i bambini 
erano vaccinati.

2. ISTRUZIONE: Il Ministero dell'Istruzione ha confermato che i bambini 
seguivano correttamente l'istruzione parentale, come altri 15.000 bambini 
in Italia.

3. ABITAZIONE: Un geometra certificato ha confermato che la struttura non 
è a rischio di stabilità.

Inoltre, una valutazione psicologica ha documentato comportamenti di 
autolesionismo emergenti nei bambini — comportamenti che non esistevano 
prima della separazione.

Chiedo rispettosamente: se tutte le giustificazioni ufficiali sono state 
dimostrate false, su quale base legale continua questa separazione?

La Sua attenzione a questa situazione contribuirebbe a sostenere i 
principi di equità, tutela dei minori e unità familiare.

Distinti saluti,

[Your Name]
[Your City/Country]
```

### Sample Posts

**Post 1: The Facts**
```
Three children were removed from their parents in Italy.

The official reasons given:
❌ "Not vaccinated" — PROVEN FALSE by health authorities
❌ "Not educated" — PROVEN FALSE by Ministry of Education
❌ "Unsafe house" — PROVEN FALSE by certified assessment

All three justifications disproven. Children still separated.

What's the real reason?

#TruthProtectsTheInnocent
```

**Post 2: The Harm**
```
A psychologist documented that children removed from their family 
are now showing self-harm behaviors.

These behaviors did not exist before the separation.

The intervention meant to "protect" them is causing documented harm.

This needs to stop.
